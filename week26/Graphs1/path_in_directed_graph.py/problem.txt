Problem Description

Given an directed graph having A nodes labelled from 1 to A containing M edges given by matrix B of size M x 2such that there is a edge directed from node

B[i][0] to node B[i][1].

Find whether a path exists from node 1 to node A.

Return 1 if path exists else return 0.

NOTE:

There are no self-loops in the graph.
There are no multiple edges between two nodes.
The graph may or may not be connected.
Nodes are numbered from 1 to A.
Your solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.
